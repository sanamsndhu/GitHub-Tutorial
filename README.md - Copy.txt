  "industry": "string",
  "address": "string",
  "createdAt": "date",
  "updatedAt": "date"
}
Organizations involved in the organization's operations are stored here, along with details such as name, type, industry, address, and timestamps.

3. Relationships

{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "individualId": "ObjectId",
  "organizationId": "ObjectId",
  "role": "string",
  "createdAt": "date",
  "updatedAt": "date"
}
This collection manages relationships between individuals and organizations, specifying roles each individual holds within an organization, along with timestamps.

4. ConflictsOfInterest

  "takenBy": "ObjectId",
  "createdAt": "date",
  "updatedAt": "date"
}
Logs actions taken to address conflicts of interest, specifying the conflict, action description, individual responsible, and timestamps.

Conclusions
Designing a MongoDB document database for Conflict of Interest Management provides flexibility and scalability to handle complex relationships and data structures efficiently. By organizing data into collections and ensuring proper indexing, querying, and reporting capabilities, the system can effectively manage conflicts of interest within an organization, promoting transparency and compliance.
